    "desc": "Is there a way to combine 4 equally random variables to get a uniform distribution of outcomes?  2 / 2  Yes, it is possible to combine 4 equally random variables to get a uniform distribution of outcomes. In fact, any combination of equally random variables will result in a uniform distribution, as long as the combination is a linear function of the variables.  For example, if X1, X2, X3, and X4 are independent and identically distributed random variables with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, then the combination Y = aX1 + bX2 + cX3 + dX4, where a, b, c, and d are constants that add up to 1 (i.e., a + b + c + d = 1), will also have a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.  This can be shown by considering the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of Y. Since Y is a linear combination of the X variables, its CDF can be expressed as a weighted sum of the CDFs of the X variables. The weights are given by the coefficients a, b, c, and d, and they sum to 1. Since the CDFs of the X variables are all linear functions with a slope of 1, the weighted sum of their CDFs will also be a linear function with a slope of 1, and therefore will be a uniform distribution.  Note that this result only applies if the random variables are independent and identically distributed, and if the combination is a linear function of the variables. If these conditions are not met, the resulting distribution may not be uniform.What if X1, X2, X3, and X4 are independent and identically distributed random variables with a uniform distribution between 0 and 2^24?  If X1, X2, X3, and X4 are independent and identically distributed random variables with a uniform distribution between 0 and 2^24, then the combination Y = aX1 + bX2 + cX3 + dX4, where a, b, c, and d are constants that add up to 1 (i.e., a + b + c + d = 1), will also have a uniform distribution between 0 and 2^24.  The proof is similar to the case where the variables have a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The CDF of Y can be expressed as a weighted sum of the CDFs of the X variables, where the weights are given by the coefficients a, b, c, and d. The CDF of each X variable is a linear function with a slope of 1/(2^24), since the probability density function is constant over the range of the variable. Therefore, the weighted sum of the CDFs will also be a linear function with a slope of 1/(2^24), and hence will be a uniform distribution between 0 and 2^24.  Note that the result only holds if the variables are independent and identically distributed, and if the combination is a linear function of the variables. If these conditions are not met, the resulting distribution may not be uniform.",
