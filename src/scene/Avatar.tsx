/**
 * Avatar.tsx — you.
 *
 * A red wireframe icosahedron marks your position in cyberspace. Same shape as
 * Onosendai v1.
 *
 * It sits at the origin, which is its own aligned cell, so the gibson point for
 * that cell falls at the exact centre of the mesh. It previously carried a 0.1
 * lift on the out axis, which floated it above a flat plane and, once the scene
 * became a volume, simply pushed it off its own gibson.
 *
 * The one exception to sitting at the origin is a commit, where it is drawn
 * trailing behind its committed cell and catches up over a few hundred
 * milliseconds. See travel.ts for why the animation lives here rather than in
 * the coordinate.
